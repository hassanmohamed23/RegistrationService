Overview
The Registration Service API is a part of the PaymentGateway project, responsible for handling user registration and account creation. It provides endpoints for users to register, verify OTP (One-Time Password) for mobile/email verification, and manage account creation via secure passcodes.

This service interacts with the system to ensure that users can create accounts with the required information while maintaining security via OTP and passcode management.
